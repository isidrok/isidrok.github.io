        I'm Isidro Torregrosa Torralba, a Lead Engineer based in Spain. Over the
        past 9+ years, I've specialized in building scalable web applications
        while transforming how teams work together. I've had the privilege of
        mentoring engineers to senior roles, leading technical decisions across
        multiple products, and helping organizations move from chaotic processes
        to predictable delivery.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical focus is the JavaScript, web development and Node.js
        ecosystem but what I really enjoy is the intersection of good code and
        good teams. I write about technical leadership, development practices,
        and how AI coding tools can enhance thoughtful engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm increasingly drawn to companies using technology for positive
        impact. If you're working on meaningful problems or interesting
        technical challenges, I'd love to connect. You can find more details
